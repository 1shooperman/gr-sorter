# Book Sorter
I am an avid reader.  Crowd sourced tools like [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) help maintain my reading list.  It (goodreads) is a fantastic piece 
of software that allows me to quickly add books, read synopses, and read reviews.  The only thing it was missing was the ability
to add custom weights to the sorting.  This started off as an excel sheet and some weighting algorithms developed by my fantastic wife (who 
also happens to be a data analyst).
